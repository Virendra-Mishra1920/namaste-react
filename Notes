npm: npm is not stand for npde package manager, it works behind like a packgae manger.

we install npm in the project using npm init command.
one we install npm, then a new file package,json will be generated . Package.josn is a config file of npm. which contains all the project level dependencies along with keep tack of min.approx versions of the dependencies via (caret ^  & tilde ~).

Note: We install 2 types of dependencies in the project.
    1. Dev dependencies: For dev purpose
    2. General dependencies: For general prod use if require

    Bundlers: Bundlers are basically bundle toghter or compress our application for production ready code. 
    We have several bundlers available in the market like webpack, parcel and veet etc.

    We are using parcel in the project so , lets install

    npm install -D parcel

    Transient dependencies: It's like a dependencies tree which has dependencies for each node of the tree.

    Package,json vs package.lock.json: 

    Package.json: Its a config file for npm. when we install npm at that time package.json file created. It contains
    all the project project level dependencies and keep  track of min/approx version of the dependencies.

   Package-lock.json:  When we installed any dependncies at that time package-lock.json file will be generated which contains exact versions of all the dependencies in the project.

   node-modules folder: It contains all the required dependencies soure  code we use in the project. IT's like a database of all the dependencies.


   Note: We never put node-modules folder to prod/git because it can be re-generated by the command npm install. But we have to put package.json and package-lock.json file on the server because based on these 2 files only npm generate node-modules folder.
